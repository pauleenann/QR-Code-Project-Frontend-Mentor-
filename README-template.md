### What I learned

I have been learning CSS for a while now. With this project, I learned how to use flexbox.

```css
body {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: var(--Light-gray);
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```
